# speech-to-text-interface
This project is a web-based application that converts speech to text using the Web Speech API and stores the transcriptions in a MySQL database. Unlike traditional interfaces, this application continuously listens and transcribes without requiring a start/stop button, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.
